      Networking is all about making connections and building relationships. After watching those videos, try reaching out to someone new or joining a group that interests you. Remember, you don’t have to be perfect—just be yourself and stay open to learning from others. Every conversation is a chance to grow your network and learn something new.

    <h2>Networking FAQ</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>I feel nervous talking to new people, what can I do to improve?</strong><br>
        That’s totally normal! Start with a simple “Hi” and ask about their work or interests. Most people are happy to chat, and it gets easier with practice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How do I find networking events at UMSI?</strong><br>
        Check your email, the UMSI website, or ask us at the Career Office. We’re always happy to point you to upcoming events!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What if I don’t know what to say at events?</strong><br>
        Try asking questions first, so you can take advantage. Questions like “What do you do?” or “How did you get started?” would be nice. People love sharing their stories, and it takes the pressure off you.
